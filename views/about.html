      <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
<p>Ada Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England. The daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron and mathematician Anne Isabella Milbanke, Ada showed a remarkable talent for mathematics and science from a young age. Under the guidance of renowned mathematicians of her time, she developed a deep interest in numbers and eventually in Charles Babbage's project, the Analytical Engine.</p>

<p>In 1843, Ada collaborated with Babbage by translating a scientific article about the machine and added a series of notes where she proposed an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli numbers. This work makes her the first programmer in history, as her algorithm is considered the first computer program ever written.</p>

<p>Ada was also a visionary: she imagined that computers could go beyond numerical calculations, foreseeing the possibility that machines could create music or art if programmed to do so.</p>
